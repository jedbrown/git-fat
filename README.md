# Introduction
Checking large binary files into a source repository (Git or otherwise) is a bad idea because repository size quickly becomes unreasonable.
Even if the instantaneous working tree stays manageable, preserving repository integrity requires all binary files in the entire project history, which given the typically poor compression of binary diffs, implies that the repository size will become impractically large.
Some people recommend checking binaries into different repositories or even not versioning them at all, but these are not satisfying solutions for most workflows.

## Features of `git-fat`
* clones of the source repository are small and fast because no binaries are transferred, yet fully functional with complete metadata and incremental retrieval (`git clone --depth` has limited granularity and couples metadata to content)
* `git-fat` supports the same workflow for large binaries and traditionally versioned files, but internally manages the "fat" files separately
* `git-bisect` works properly even when versions of the binary files change over time
* selective control of which large files to pull into the local store
* local fat object stores can be shared between multiple clones, even by different users
* can easily support fat object stores distributed across multiple hosts
* depends only on stock Python and rsync

## Related projects
* [git-annex](http://git-annex.branchable.com) is a far more comprehensive solution, but with less transparent workflow and with more dependencies.
* [git-media](https://github.com/schacon/git-media) adopts a similar approach to `git-fat`, but with a different synchronization philosophy and with many Ruby dependencies.

# Installation and configuration
Place `git-fat` in your `PATH`.

Edit (or create) `.gitattributes` to regard any desired extensions as fat files.

    $ cd path-to-your-repository
    $ cat >> .gitattributes
    *.png filter=fat -crlf
    *.jpg filter=fat -crlf
    *.gz  filter=fat -crlf
    ^D

Run `git fat init` to activate the extension. Now add and commit as usual.
Matched files will be transparently stored externally, but will appear
complete in the working tree.

Set a remote store for the fat objects by editing `.gitfat`.

    [rsync]
    remote = your.remote-host.org:/share/fat-store

This file should typically be committed to the repository so that others
will automatically have their remote set. This remote address can use
any protocol supported by rsync. 

Most users will configure it to use remote ssh in a directory with shared 
access. To do this, set the `sshuser` and `sshport` variables in `.gitfat` 
configuration file. For example, to use rsync with ssh, with the default
port (22) and authenticate with the user "_fat_", your configuration would 
look like this: 

    [rsync]
    remote = your.remote-host.org:/share/fat-store
    sshuser = fat

# A worked example

Before we start, let's turn on verbose reporting so we can see what's
happening. Without this environment variable, all the output lines
starting with `git-fat` will not be shown.

    $ export GIT_FAT_VERBOSE=1

First, we create a repository and configure it for use with `git-fat`.

    $ git init repo
    Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/repo/.git/
    $ cd repo
    $ git fat init
    $ cat > .gitfat
    [rsync]
    remote = localhost:/tmp/fat-store
    $ mkdir -p /tmp/fat-store               # make sure the remote directory exists
    $ echo '*.gz filter=fat -crlf' > .gitattributes
    $ git add .gitfat .gitattributes
    $ git commit -m'Initial repository'
    [master (root-commit) eb7facb] Initial repository
     2 files changed, 3 insertions(+)
     create mode 100644 .gitattributes
     create mode 100644 .gitfat

Now we add a binary file whose name matches the pattern we set in `.gitattributes`.

    $ curl https://nodeload.github.com/jedbrown/git-fat/tar.gz/master -o master.tar.gz
      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

    $ git add master.tar.gz
    git-fat filter-clean: caching to /tmp/repo/.git/fat/objects/b3489819f81603b4c04e8ed134b80bace0810324
    $ git commit -m'Added master.tar.gz'

    git-fat filter-clean: caching to /tmp/repo/.git/fat/objects/b3489819f81603b4c04e8ed134b80bace0810324
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
     create mode 100644 master.tar.gz

The patch itself is very simple and does not include the binary.

    $ git show --pretty=oneline HEAD
    918063043a6156172c2ad66478c6edd5c7df0217 Add master.tar.gz

## Pushing fat files
Now let's push our fat files using the rsync configuration that we set up earlier.

    $ git fat push
    Pushing to localhost:/tmp/fat-store
    building file list ...
    1 file to consider

    sent 61 bytes  received 12 bytes  48.67 bytes/sec
    total size is 6449  speedup is 88.34

We might normally set a remote now and push the git repository.

## Cloning and pulling
Now let's look at what happens when we clone.

    $ cd ..
    $ git clone repo repo2
    Cloning into 'repo2'...
    done.
    $ cd repo2
    $ git fat init                          # don't forget
    $ ls -l                                 # file is just a placeholder
    total 4
    -rw-r--r--  1 jed  users  53 Nov 25 22:42 master.tar.gz
    $ cat master.tar.gz                     # holds the SHA1 of the file
    #$# git-fat 1f218834a137f7b185b498924e7a030008aee2ae

We can always get a summary of what fat objects are missing in our local cache.

    $ git fat status
    Orphan objects:
        1f218834a137f7b185b498924e7a030008aee2ae

Now get any objects referenced by our current `HEAD`. This command also
accepts the `--all` option to pull full history, or a revision to pull
selected history.

    $ git fat pull
    receiving file list ...
    1 file to consider
    1f218834a137f7b185b498924e7a030008aee2ae

    git-fat filter-smudge: restoring from /tmp/repo2/.git/fat/objects/1f218834a137f7b185b498924e7a030008aee2ae

Everything is in place

    $ git status
    git-fat filter-clean: caching to /tmp/repo2/.git/fat/objects/1f218834a137f7b185b498924e7a030008aee2ae
    # On branch master
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
    $ ls -l                                 # recovered the full file
    total 8

## Summary
* Set the "fat" file types in `.gitattributes`.
* Use normal git commands to interact with the repository without
  thinking about what files are fat and non-fat. The fat files will be
  treated specially.
* Synchronize fat files with `git fat push` and `git fat pull`.

## Retroactive import using `git filter-branch` [Experimental]

Sometimes large objects were added to a repository by accident or for
lack of a better place to put them. _If_ you are willing to rewrite
history, forcing everyone to reclone, you can retroactively manage those
files with `git fat`. Be sure that you understand the consequences of
`git filter-branch` before attempting this. This feature is experimental
and irreversible, so be doubly careful with backups.

### Step 1: Locate the fat files

Run `git fat find THRESH_BYTES > fat-files` and inspect `fat-files` in
an editor. Lines will be sorted by the maximum object size that has been
at each path, and look like

    something.big           filter=fat -text #    8154677 1

where the first number after the `#` is the number of bytes and the
second number is the number of modifications that path has seen. You
will normally filter out some of these paths using grep and/or an
editor. When satisfied, remove the ends of the lines (including the `#`)
and append to `.gitattributes`. It's best to `git add .gitattributes` and commit
at this time (likely enrolling some extant files into `git fat`).

### Step 2: `filter-branch`

Copy `.gitattributes` to `/tmp/fat-filter-files` and edit to remove
everything after the file name (e.g., `sed s/ \+filter=fat.*$//`).
Currently, this may only contain exact paths relative to the root of the
repository. Finally, run

    git filter-branch --index-filter                 \
        'git fat index-filter /tmp/fat-filter-files --manage-gitattributes' \
        --tag-name-filter cat -- --all

(You can remove the `--manage-gitattributes` option if you don't want to
append all the files being enrolled in `git fat` to `.gitattributes`,
however, future users would need to use `.git/info/attributes` to have
the `git fat` fileters run.)
When this finishes, inspect to see if everything is in order and follow
the
[Checklist for Shrinking a Repository](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-filter-branch.html#_checklist_for_shrinking_a_repository)
in the `git filter-branch` man page, typically `git clone
file:///path/to/repo`. Be sure to `git fat push` from the original
repository.

See the script `test-retroactive.sh` for an example of cleaning.

## Implementation notes
The actual binary files are stored in `.git/fat/objects`, leaving `.git/objects` nice and small.

    $ du -bs .git/objects
    2212    .git/objects/
    $ ls -l .git/fat/objects                # This is where the file actually goes, but that's not important
    total 8
    -rw------- 1 jed users 6449 Nov 25 17:01 1f218834a137f7b185b498924e7a030008aee2ae

If you have multiple clones that access the same filesystem, you can make
`.git/fat/objects` a symlink to a common location, in which case all content
will be available in all repositories without extra copies. You still need to
`git fat push` to make it available to others.

# Some refinements
* Allow pulling and pushing only select files
* Relate orphan objects to file system
* Put some more useful message in smudged (working tree) version of missing files.
* More friendly configuration for multiple fat remotes
* Make commands safer in presence of a dirty tree.
* Private setting of a different remote.
* Gracefully handle unmanaged files when the filter is called (either
  legacy files or files matching the pattern that should some reason not
  be treated as fat).
